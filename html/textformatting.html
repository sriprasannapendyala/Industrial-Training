        <p><blockquote> <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> or <bold>HTML</bold> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a <mark>browser</mark> . </blockquote>It defines the  meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <u>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</u> and scripting languages such as <tt>JavaScript</tt>.
        <br><br>
        Web browsers receive <bold><bdo dir="ltr">LMTH</bdo></bold> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page <em>semantically</em> and <i>originally</i> included cues for its appearance.
        <br><br>
        HTML elements are the <del>builtin</del> building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
